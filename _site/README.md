    <p><strong>Hi, I'm Ashley!</strong></p>
    <p>I'm a first-year graduate student pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science at UC San Diego. With a background in probability and statistics, I've developed a passion for the intersection of theory and real-world data applications. In addition to my academic pursuits, I work as a Graduate Teaching Assistant, helping students navigate data science concepts, and Iâ€™m actively involved in research focused on neural networks and machine learning. My goal is to combine my technical expertise with a strong foundation in mathematics to contribute to data-driven innovations.</p>
